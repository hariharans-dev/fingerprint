# Fingerprint Recognition System

## Overview

The **Fingerprint Recognition System** is a biometric security project designed to identify individuals based on their unique fingerprint patterns. This project leverages advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to ensure high accuracy and robustness in fingerprint matching.

## Features

- **Fingerprint Enrollment**: Users can securely enroll their fingerprints into the system database.
- **Fingerprint Matching**: Matches input fingerprints against stored templates using optimized matching algorithms.
- **Secure Storage**: Stores fingerprint data in a secure and encrypted format.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a large number of fingerprint records with efficient search and retrieval.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Can be deployed on various platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for optional deep learning enhancements)
- **Database**: SQLite (or other database systems like MySQL, MongoDB as needed)
- **Encryption**: AES (for secure fingerprint data storage)
